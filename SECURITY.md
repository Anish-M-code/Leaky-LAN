# Using Leaky-LAN Securely

Leaky-LAN Project uses Python's http.server module which is not recommended for production use as it implements only basic security checks.

It is strongly advised to use leaky lan only on secure trusted networks , all data transferred using Leaky-LAN is unencrypted
and its usage for file sharing can be easily detected by simple port scans in local area network.

## Reporting Security Issues

For all my personal projects in Github , i strongly believe in Full Public disclosure by making the details of security vulnerabilities public .
I feel Public scrutiny is the only reliable way to improve security, while secrecy only makes us less secure.

Like all other issues Feel free to open a Github Issue regarding the issue. 

Note: I cannot gurantee that all security problems brought to my attention will be fixed within a reasonable timeframe , as this is an personal
project but mostly such issues will be fixed as soon as possible.
